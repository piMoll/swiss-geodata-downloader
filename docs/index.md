## About
This plugin allows you to download swiss geodata in an easy and convenient way. Just select a topic, specify the data options and define the download extent. The plugin requests files, downloads and adds them as layers to QGIS.

Currently, the plugin provides access to some of the most requested topics like the precise height model [swissALTI3D](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/geodata/height/alti3d.html) or the [national maps](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/geodata/maps/smr/smr25.html). Additional swisstopo data and further providers will be added in future releases.


## Download
Download this plugin directly from the QGIS plugin manager by searching for _Swiss Geo Downloader_.
